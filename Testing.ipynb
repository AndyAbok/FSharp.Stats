"FSharp.Stats provides hypothesis tests for different applications.\n",
"A hypothesis test is a statistical test that is used to determine whether there is enough evidence \n",
"in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true for the entire population. \n",
"A hypothesis test examines two opposing hypotheses about a population: the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.\n",

"### T-Test\n",
"\n",
"By using a t test a difference of means can be evaluated. There are different kinds of t test designs implemented in FSharp.Stats.\n",
"\n",
"1. One sample t test:\n",
"\n",
"  - Is the population mean equal to the value of H0?\n",
"\n",
"  - e.g. “Is my grade different from the distribution mean?”\n",
"  \n",
"2. Two sample t test with equal variances:\n",
"\n",
"  - Prerequisite: equal variances\n",
"  \n",
"  - Is the mean of Population A equal to the mean of Population B?\n",
"  \n",
"  - 2.1 unpaired t test:\n",
"\n",
"    - e.g.: Does the cell size differ between wildtype and mutant?\n",
"\n",
"  - 2.2 paired t test:\n",
"\n",
"    - e.g.: Does the medication influence the blood pressure? Measurement of the same persons before and after medication.\n",
"\n",
"3. Two sample t test with unequal variances\n",
"  \n",
"  - Welch test (unpaired)\n",

"The F-test is a method to determine if the variances of two samples are homogeneous.\n",

"  -   population distributions are normally distributed \n",

"Note that there is no information about the direction of variance difference (e.g. Zimmermann 2004).\n",
"In this implemented test the larger variance is always the numerator, therefore the comparison to F\u003csub\u003edf1,df2,1-(alpha/2)\u003c/sub\u003e is used for a two sided test. \n",

"### H Test\n",
"\n",
"The H test is also known as Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis-of-variance-by-ranks and is the non-parametric equivalent of one-way ANOVA. \n",
"It is a non-parametric test for comparing the means of more than two independent samples (equal or different sample size), and therefore is an extension of Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney two sample test.\n",
"Testing with H test gives information whether the samples are from the same distribution.\n",
"\n",
"A benefit of the H test is that it does not require normal distribution of the samples.\n",
"The downside is that there is no information which samples are different from each other, or how many differences occur. For further investigation a post hoc test is recommended. \n",
"\n",
"The distribution of the H test statistic is approximated by chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom = sample count - 1. \n",
"\n",
"The implemented H-test is testing for duplicate values in the data. \n",
"Duplicates lead to ties in the ranking, and are corrected by using a correction factor. \n",
"\n",
"Prerequisites:\n",
"\n",
"  - random and independent samples\n",
