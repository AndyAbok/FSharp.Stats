<h1><a name="Probability-Distributions" class="anchor" href="#Probability-Distributions">Probability Distributions</a></h1>
<p>FSharp.Stats provides a wide range of probability distributions. Given the
distribution parameters they can be used to investigate their statistical properties
or to sample non-uniform random numbers.</p>
<p>For every distribution the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative probability function (CDF) can be accessed.
By using the PDF you can access the probability for exacty X=k success states. The CDF is used when the cumulative probabilities of X&lt;=k is required.</p>

<h3><a name="Normal-distribution" class="anchor" href="#Normal-distribution">Normal distribution</a></h3>
<p>The normal or Gaussian distribution is a very common continuous probability distribution.
Due to the central limit theorem, randomly sampled means of a random and independent distribution tend to approximate a normal distribution
It describes the probability, that under a given mean and
a given dispersion (standard deviation) an event occurs exactly k times.</p>
<p>It is defined by two parameters N(mu,tau):</p>
<ul>
<li>mu = mean</li>
<li>tau = standard deviation</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: The distribution of bread weights of a local manufacturer follow a normal distribution with mean 500 g and a standard
deviation of 20 g.</p>
<p>NormA: What is the probability of bread weights to be lower than 470 g?</p>
<p>NormB: What is the probability of bread weights to be higher than 505 g?</p>
<p>NormC: Sample independently 10 values from the normal distribution and calculate their mean.</p>

<p>The binomial distribution describes the probability, that under a given success probability and
a given number of draws an event occurs exactly k times (with replacement).</p>
<p>It is defined by two parameters B(n,p):</p>
<ul>
<li>n = number of draws</li>
<li>p = probability of success</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: The school bus is late with a probability of 0.10.</p>
<p>BinoA: What is the probability of running late exactly 5 times during a 30 day month?</p>
<p>BinoB: What is the probability of running late for a maximum of 5 times?</p>
<p>BinoC: What is the probability of running late for at least 5 times?</p>

<h3><a name="Hypergerometric-distribution" class="anchor" href="#Hypergerometric-distribution">Hypergerometric distribution</a></h3>
<p>The hypergeometric distribution describes the probability, that under a given number of success and failure events and
a given number of draws an event occurs exactly k times (without replacement).</p>
<p>It is defined by three parameters Hyp(n,s,f):</p>
<ul>
<li>n = number of draws</li>
<li>s = number of success events</li>
<li>f = number of failure events</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: You participate in a lottery, where you have to choose 6 numbers out of 49. The lottery queen draws 6 numbers randomly,
where the order does not matter.</p>
<p>HypA: What is the probability that your 6 numbers are right?</p>
<p>HypB: What is the probability that you have at least 3 right ones?</p>
<p>HypC: What is the probability that you have a maximum of 3 right ones?</p>
