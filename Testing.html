<p>FSharp.Stats provides hypothesis tests for different applications.
A hypothesis test is a statistical test that is used to determine whether there is enough evidence
in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true for the entire population.
A hypothesis test examines two opposing hypotheses about a population: the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.

<p>By using a t test a difference of means can be evaluated. There are different kinds of t test designs implemented in FSharp.Stats.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One sample t test:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the population mean equal to the value of H0?</li>
<li>e.g. “Is my grade different from the distribution mean?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two sample t test with equal variances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prerequisite: equal variances</li>
<li>Is the mean of Population A equal to the mean of Population B?</li>
<li>
<p>2.1 unpaired t test:</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g.: Does the cell size differ between wildtype and mutant?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>2.2 paired t test:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bsp.: Does the medication influence the blood pressure? Measurement of the same persons before and after medication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two sample t test with unequal variances</p>
<ul>
<li>Welch test (unpaired)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Case 3: Two sample t test with equal variances (paired)</em></p>
<p>A paired t-test is used to compare two population means where you have two samples in
which observations in one sample can be paired with observations in the other sample.
Examples of where this might occur are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Before-and-after observations on the same subjects (e.g. students’ diagnostic test
results before and after a particular module or course).
</li>
<li>
A comparison of two different methods of measurement or two different treatments
where the measurements/treatments are applied to the same subjects (e.g. blood
pressure measurements using a stethoscope and a dynamap).
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="F-Test" class="anchor" href="#F-Test">F-Test</a></h2>
<p>The F-test is a method to determine if the variances of two samples are homogeneous.
Also, ANOVA (analysis of variance) is based on the F-test and is used for the comparison of more than two samples.
Knowing if your variances are equal (H<sub>0</sub> is true) helps to decide which test should be performed next.
To determine if your variances are in fact equal you can perform a F-test.</p>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>population distributions are normally distributed</li>
<li>samples are independent</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible further tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>two sample t-test with equal variances</li>
<li>two sample t-test with unequal variances (Welch-test)</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there is no information about the direction of variance difference.
In this implemented test the larger variance is always the numerator, therefore the comparison to F<sub>df1,df2,1-(alpha/2)</sub> is used for a two sided test.</p>
<p><em>Important note: The effectiveness of a preliminary test of variances is discussed.
The F-test is extremely sensitive to normality-violations, and even if the samples follow a normal distribution, it often does not detect situations where a t-test should be avoided.</em></p>

<h2><a name="H-Test" class="anchor" href="#H-Test">H Test</a></h2>
<p>The H test is also known as Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis-of-variance-by-ranks and is the non-parametric equivalent of one-way ANOVA.
It is a non-parametric test for comparing the means of more than two independent samples (equal or different sample size), and therefore is an extension of Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney two sample test.
Testing with H test gives information whether the samples are from the same distribution.</p>
<p>A benefit of the H test is that it does not require normal distribution of the samples.
The downside is that there is no information which samples are different from each other, or how many differences occur. For further investigation a post hoc test is recommended.</p>
<p>The distribution of the H test statistic is approximated by chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom = sample count - 1.</p>
<p>The implemented H-test is testing for duplicate values in the data.
Duplicates lead to ties in the ranking, and are corrected by using a correction factor.</p>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>random and independent samples</li>
<li>observations are from populations with same shape of distribution</li>
<li>nominal scale, ordinal scale, ratio scale or interval scale data</li>

<p>ANOVA provides the user with a global statement if samples differ from each other. It does not provide detailed information regarding
differences of the single samples.</p>
<p>If the H<sub>0</sub> hypothesis is neglected (so significant differences are assumed), a post hoc test (multiple comparison test) allows the pairwise comparison of the
individual groups.</p>

<h3><a name="Fisher-s-LSD" class="anchor" href="#Fisher-s-LSD">Fisher's LSD</a></h3>
<p>The most simple method is Fisher's least significant difference (Fisher's LSD). It calculates Student's t tests for all pairwise comparisons. But instead of
estimating the variance for each sample separately it takes all groups into account. Violations of the homogeneity of variances reduce the test power.
Since no correction for multiple comparisons is performed, the resulting p values must be corrected (for example with Benjamini-Hochberg method).</p>

<h3><a name="Tukey-HSD" class="anchor" href="#Tukey-HSD">Tukey HSD</a></h3>
<p>Tukeys honestly significant difference (HSD) can be used to inspect a significant ANOVA result for underlying causes.</p>
<p><em>Important note: Various discussions question the application of Tukeys HSD only to significant ANOVA results (Anova-protected post-hoc test), since Tukeys HSD already controls for multiple testing.</em>
<em>Inform yourself prior to using an post hoc test appropriate to your experimental design.</em></p>
<p>Using this post hoc test you can determine which of the means differ significantly from each other.
In the classis Tukeys HSD approach, the population variances are pooled for a more robust estimation (especially with small sample sizes). If the population variances
differ, Tukeys HSD is not appropriate.</p>
<p>The implemented Tukey-Kramer-Method can be applied on unequal sample sizes and estimates the variance based on the meas to compare.
The Tukey-Kramer method can be used as stand-alone method for comparing multiple means.</p>
<p>A comparison of ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer-HSD with simulations for the robustness of normality-violations of the data can be found in:</p>
<p><em>Robustness of the ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer Statistical Tests, Wade C. Driscoll, Computers ind. Engng Vol 31, No. 1/2, pp. 265 - 268, 1996</em></p>
<p>Multiple-to-one comparisons can alternatively performed with Dunnet's test, which was designed for performing k-1 tests, while Tukeys
HSD performs k((k-1)/2) tests.</p>
<p>Task: It should be tested if one or more means of samples taken from different mutants differ from each other.</p>

<p>To compensate this inflation, several multiple testing corrections were published.
The most conservative method is the Bonferroni correction, where the used &alpha; level is divided by the number of performed tests.</p>
<p>A modern correction approach is the Benjamini-Hochberg method also known as FDR (false discovery rate).</p>
